# myVGL

Need to add requirements.txt and figure out how to do node requirements, but for now
pip install django, djangorestframework, environ, Pillow, requests 

in frontend/

npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev

npm i @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react --save-dev

npm i react react-dom --save-dev

remember to run python manage.py runserver in one shell and in a second npm run dev (only when you make changes to frontend/)
